## QUESTION: 1 ##
**1s complement?**
### ***Explanation :*** ###
     To get 1’s complement of a binary number, simply invert the given number.
     For example -
        Suppose the number is = 174
        To convert the number into binary representation that is = 10101110.
        Simply invert each bit of given binary number, so 1's compliment of given number will be = 01010001.
     
## QUESTION: 2 ##
**2s complement?**
### ***Explanation :*** ###
      To get 2’s complement of a binary number, simply invert the 1s complement given number and add 1 to the least significant bit (LSB) of given result.
      For example -
        Suppose the number is = 174
        To convert the number into binary representation  is = 10101110.
        1's complement of given number is = 01010001.
        2's complement of binary number is = (01010001 + 1) =  010100110.
