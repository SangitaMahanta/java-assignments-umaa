## QUESTION: 1 ##
**1s complement?**
### ***Explanation :*** ###
     A 1's complement system or ones' complement arithmetic is a system in which negative numbers are 
     represented by the inverse of the binary representations of their corresponding positive numbers.
     In such a system, a number is negated (converted from positive to negative or vice versa) by computing its ones' complement.
     An N-bit ones' complement numeral system can only represent integers in the range −(2N−1−1) to 2N−1−1
